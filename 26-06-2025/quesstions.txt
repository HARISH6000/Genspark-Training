1. You have a file with permissions -rw-r--r--, and you run chmod +x file.sh. What happens?

-rwxr-xr-x


2. What is the difference between chmod 744 file.txt and chmod u=rwx,go=r file.txt?

Both achieve the same,
-rwxr--r--


3. What is the sticky bit, and when should you use it?

The sticky bit is a special permission that ensures only the file owner, the directory owner, or the root user can delete or modify files within a directory.
chmod +t directory_name
the output permission is like: drwxr-xr-t


4. You are told to give the owner full access, group only execute, and others no permissions. What symbolic command achieves this?

chmod u=rwx,g=x,o= directory_name


5. What is umask, and why is it important?

It subtracts permissions from the systemâ€™s default permissions.


6. If the umask is 022, what are the default permissions for a new file and a new directory?

Files: 666 - 022 = 644 (rw-r--r--).

Directories: 777 - 022 = 755 (rwxr-xr-x).


7. Why is umask often set to 002 in development environments but 027 or 077 in production?

Default permissions allow group write access (775 for directories, 664 for files).
Facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing the group to edit files.

umask 027: Group: Read-only access, Others: No access.
umask 077: Group: No access, Others: No access.

8.  adduser provides a more interactive and user-friendly interface for creating user accounts, useradd directly modifies system files (like /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) to create a new user.
